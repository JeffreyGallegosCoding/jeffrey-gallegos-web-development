		<h1>Personal Website Milestone 1</h1>
		<h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>

				<strong>Purpose:</strong> This personal website project will show off my professional experiences and
				skills as a web developer to potential employers.
			</p>
			<p>

				I am wanting to appeal to either free lance start up companies or industries already established in New Mexico.
			</p>
			<p>

			understanding of web design and development in hopes of being hired for a full time, part time, or internship opportunity.

		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Name:</strong> Nancy T. Thomas</p>
			<p><strong>Age:</strong> 35</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Profession:</strong> Lead Web Developer of a locally born, New Mexican start up tech company.
				Although it began just a year ago, it has been gaining some steady footing in the community and is now in a
				position to hire more part time and full time full stack web developers. The company specializes in all aspects
				of web design. With an ever expanding set of departments from the front end, back end, desktop and mobile, and graphics,
				the company would really benefit from hiring some more full stack web developers to be able assist and incorporate
				their skills into each.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Power user of windows systems while working using a HP Spectre x360 laptop for
			the office and at home. But also enjoys using her IphoneXS and IPad Pro for work but mainly for recreational
			purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Nancy is a very active person not just in the working community
				but also in her social life. She works a full time position and has a family to help take care of outside
				of that. Since their company is still fairly new, she likes to take little extra time at the end of her work
				day to look through some resumes and see if there are any promising candidates for a position.
				Although she is using more traditional methods and enjoys reading through well constructed resumes, she also believes that
				having a quality online presence on sites such as LinkedIn are just as important. One element of an
				online presence that she is really drawn to is a personal website. Especially one that is well organized and
				really able to show off the skills and experiences of the individual's coding career.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Nancy is looking for some fresh talent to be part of her full stack
				web development team. She is looking for candidates to not only have a drive for functionality, but also the ability
				to write clear and concise code and have organized web design. With the company still growing, she has gone
				through and looked at many potential web developers but she must be able to make a decision before
				next week. She requires that all candidates have experience in:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The different elements of front end and back end programming such as; HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL</li>
				<li>Creating secure programs and sites for both front end and back end systems</li>
				<li>Version control systems</li>
				<li>Data Design and the UI/UX System</li>
				<li>Working as a team, public speaking, and effective communication skills</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Goals:</strong> Nancy has to figure out which candidates would be able to make it to the next round of the
				hiring process. Many of them have a well constructed resume, an established online presence, and astounding personal websites,
				but she insists on using the personal websites to make the final decision. She must check carefully to see which sites
				are the most creative, organized, and comply fully with her specific standards of what makes a great web page.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>User Story:</strong> As a power user, Nancy has to determine whether a candidate's personal website is up to
				her standards of what a web developer's skills should be at going into a position at their company.
