		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<div>
		<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
			<p>This will be a personal introduction which may include a description of myself, my name, or maybe a
				favorite quote that I have. I want to include a picture of myself and maybe some background imagery
				behind the text.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
			<p>This will be a brief introduction of my skills and experiences in the technological field. I might include
			a brief story of how I got introduced into the coding field and why, along with all of my other occupational experiences.
				I will talk more about myself and some things that I enjoy about coding and passions outside of coding.
			Maybe include a dream job having to do with the web development or any projects that I would like to work on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Portfolio</strong></p>
			<p>This will display all of the projects that I have worked on throughout the class. I want to add some
			flavor to this section to really make it jump out. Maybe some cool styling in the project links, or maybe just
			a cool picture with a description that will appear when you hover over the image. I should also include my place
			in the project, the technology used, and a more in depth description of what we were trying to accomplish with
			the project.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Contact Info</strong></p>
			<p>This section will contain links to my email and my Github and LinkedIn profiles. I may try to also include an interactive
			system for employers to leave their contact information on the web page if they would like, so I may be able to get in contact
			with them as well.
