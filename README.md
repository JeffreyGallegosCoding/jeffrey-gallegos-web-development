#### Feedback
Good Job on Milestone 2a the road map you laid out will be extremely beneficial when you begin development. The only concern I want to raise is that the mobile and desktop wireframes do not match in a couple of different areas. These areas include the sidebar you laid out in the intro section of the mobile wireframes and the side image you have running the length of the portfolio section. It is important to remember that both the mobile and desktop views are of the same site. Having deferent layouts means that any differences have to addressed using media queries to load specific UI elements depending on screen size. This practice can be time consuming and buggy. I recommend getting rid of both UI elements.
